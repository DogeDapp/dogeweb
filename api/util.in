:description: Making asyncio even better


:class: StreamReaderProtocol
  Same as [asyncio.StreamReaderProtocol]((stdlib,asyncio-streams)), except the task
  spawned in `connection_made` is stored in the `task` attribute and cancelled
  in `connection_lost` instead of being left at the mercy of the garbage collector.

  An [asyncio.StreamReader]((stdlib,asyncio-streams)) is also created automatically;
  no need to pass your own.


:function: timelimit delay task loop
  Wait for a task or a coroutine to complete, but only if it manages to do so
  in the next `delay` seconds. If not, cancel it (and raise `asyncio.CancelledError`.)

  This function is a [coroutine](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#coroutine).


:function: start_server callback (...)
  Same as [asyncio.start_server]((stdlib,asyncio-streams)), but uses
  [StreamReaderProtocol]((this)) instead of the asyncio-provided one.
  Also, this function accepts a list of sockets as its `sock` argument
  (unlike `asyncio.start_server`, which can only accept one socket.)

  This function is a [coroutine](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#coroutine).


:function: create_server protocol_factory (...)
  Same as `asyncio.BaseEventLoop.create_server`, but can accept a list of sockets
  as its `sock` argument (unlike the default `create_server`, which can only
  accept one socket.)

  This function is a [coroutine](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#coroutine).
