:class: app handler (Optional onerror) (Optional timeout)
  Create a complete application. `handler` is a function that accepts
  [request.Request](request/#Request)s and returns something that can be converted
  into a [response.Response](response/#Response). `onerror` is a function that
  accepts a [request.Response](request/#Request) and a
  [request.Abort](response/#Abort), but is otherwise similar to a handler.
  `timeout` is how long to wait for requests, in seconds. The timer starts at the
  beginning of the connection or after sending a response over a `keep-alive`
  connection, and ends just before handling the request.

  Also available as `main.Server`.

:method: __call__ loop
  Construct a callback for [asyncio.StreamReaderProtocol](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-stream.html#streamreaderprotocol)
  that would read requests, call handlers, and write responses when used.


:method: run (...)
  Start a development server. The arguments are the same as for
  [util.start_server](util/#start_server), except that `callback` is already provided.
  This method does not return unless you manually stop the event loop.


:function: abort code (Optional info) (Optional headers)
  Same as [response.abort](response/#abort).


:function: redirect path (Optional info) (Optional code)
  Same as [response.redirect](response/#redirect).


:function: static path (Optional attachment) (Optional headers)
  Same as [response.static](response/#static).


:function: jsonify smth
  Same as [response.jsonify](response/#jsonify).
