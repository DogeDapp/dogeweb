:description: a neater representation of HTTP requests


:class: Request
  A single HTTP request. Instances of this class are created by
  [app](../#app) automatically; you don't need to do that yourself.

:attribute: version
  The HTTP version the client used as a `(major, minor)` tuple.

:attribute: method
  The HTTP method used by the client, e.g. `GET` or `POST`.

:attribute: path
  The path requested by the client. Relative to the current routine module
  (see [route.dir](../route/#dir).)

:attribute: headers
  Additional HTTP headers as a [struct.Headers](../struct/#Headers).

:attribute: payload
  The request body as a `bytes` object.

:attribute: handler
  The top-level handler this request was passed to (the one you created an instance of
  [app](../#app) with.)

:attribute: loop
  The [asyncio event loop](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html)
  everything is running in.

:attribute: log
  A [logging.Logger](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logger) named `dogeweb`.

:attribute: accept
  Parsed values of various `Accept` headers.

    * `accept.mime` -- `Accept`
    * `accept.charset` -- `Accept-Charset`
    * `accept.language` -- `Accept-Language`
    * `accept.encoding` -- `Accept-Encoding`

  All of these are represented by [struct.Accept](../struct/#Accept) objects.
  MIME types, charsets, or whatever not specified in the request will have a quality
  of 0.

:attribute: cookies
  All cookies from this request as a dict.

:attribute: args
  Form fields passed through the URL (the part after `?`) as a [struct.MultiDict](../struct/#MultiDict).

:attribute: form
  Form fields passed through the request body. This includes files, too.

:attribute: files
  Same as `form`, but only top-level files are included. Removes the need for some
  type-checking.

:attribute: isxhr
  Whether this request was made through `XmlHttpRequest` (aka AJAX).

:attribute: isjson
  Whether the client expects JSON instead of HTML. Useful for building APIs.

:attribute: address
  The IP address of the client as a string.

:attribute: fullpath
  The requested path. This one is absolute, unlike `path`, which is relative to the module.

:attribute: parent
  The difference between `fullpath` and `path.

:method: url_for __name **: args
  Given the name of a route (in a syntax similar to Python relative imports)
  and some keyword arguments, construct an URL that points to that route.

  For example, given this route structure:

  ```plain
  /hello/    -> modhello (module)
    /world/    -> world
    /user/     -> user
  /          -> main (module)
    /          -> root
    /login/    -> login
    /u/<name>/ -> userinfo
  ```

  Suppose the user has requested `/hello/user/`, meaning the current route's path
  is `modhello.user` and the currently used module is `modhello`. Here's what
  different calls to `url_for` would return:

  ```dg
  url_for '.world'                     -> '/hello/world/'
  url_for '..modhello.user'            -> '/hello/user/'
  url_for '..main.root'                -> '/'
  url_for 'main.login'                 -> '/login/'
  url_for 'main.userinfo' name: 'spam' -> '/u/spam/'
  ```

:method: websocket handler
  Initiate a websocket handshake. May abort the request with 400; if not, returns a
  [response.Response](../response/#Response) with appropriate headers. After these are sent,
  `handler` will be called with a reader and a writer. See [websocket.Reader](../websocket/#Reader)
  and [websocket.Writer](../websocket/#Writer) for details.

:note:
  The following methods do not use any info from the request; they're shortcuts.

:method: abort code (Optional info) (Optional headers)
  Same as [response.abort](../response/#abort).

:method: redirect path (Optional info) (Optional code)
  Same as [response.redirect](../response/#redirect).

:method: static path (Optional attachment) (Optional headers)
  Same as [response.static](../response/#static).

:method: jsonify smth
  Same as [response.jsonify](../response/#jsonify).
