:description: an HTTP response wrapper


:function: responsify smth
  Convert some object into a [Response]((this)). Supported objects are:
  
    * [Response]((this)) objects (returned as-is);
    * strings (assumed to be utf-8 HTML);
    * bytestrings (assumed to be HTML with a `<meta>` tag specifying the encoding);
    * `(code, *headers, something_else)` tuples where `something_else` is
      one of the other supported objects and `headers` is an arbitrary amount
      of `(name, value)` tuples;
    * [coroutines](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#coroutine)
      that return any of the above.

  This function is a [coroutine](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#coroutine).


:function: jsonify smth
  Encode a JSON object with `json.dumps`, return a [Response]((this))
  with an appropriate `Content-Type` set.


:class: Abort code (Optional description) (Optional headers)
  An exception that signals HTTP errors. `description` must be a string;
  `headers` — something that can be converted into a dict.

:attribute: code
:attribute: description
:attribute: headers
  Now as a [struct.Headers]((local)).

:attribute: name
  What this error code means according to the HTTP standard.


:class: Response code headers data
  A single-chunk response. `bytes` must be a `bytes`, `headers` — something that
  can be converted into a dict.

:attribute: code
:attribute: description
:attribute: data
  A list of chunks.

:attribute: headers
  Now as a [struct.Headers]((local)).

:attribute: defheaders
  A property that returns some headers. These will be sent to the client
  unless overriden in the constructor. By default, these are:

    * `Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8`
    * `Content-Length`: whatever the length of `data` is.

:method: communicate reader writer
  Called after the response is sent to the client. `reader` is an
  [asyncio.StreamReader]((stdlib,asyncio-streams)) the request was received from,
  `writer` is an [asyncio.StreamWriter]((stdlib,asyncio-streams)) the response was
  sent through. Useful for upgrading to other protocols (e.g. HTTP 2 or WebSocket.)


:class: FileResponse code path headers (Optional bufsize)
  A response that sends data from a local file instead of a string.
  Inherits [Response]((this)). If the file does not exist or is not readable,
  constructor throws HTTP 404.

:attribute: path
:attribute: bufsize
:attribute: defheaders
  Same as [Response.defheaders]((this)), except `Content-Length` is determined
  via [os.stat]((stdlib,os)).

:attribute: data
  A property that returns an iterator of chunks, the closes the file
  after yielding the last one.


:function: abort code (Optional info) (Optional headers)
  Raise [Abort]((this)). Accepts the same arguments.


:function: redirect path (Optional info) (Optional code)
  Issue a redirect to another path by raising `Abort` with a `Location` header.
  By default, `code` is 302 (Found).


:function: static path (Optional attachment) (Optional headers)
  Guess the MIME type from the file name, create a [FileResponse]((this)).
  If `attachment` is true, `Content-Disposition` is set to `attachment`
  (meaning browsers will download the file instead of attempting to display it.)

  **NOTE**: this function will happily send *any* file; normalize the filename first
  if you've received it from an unknown source! For example, a client can easily
  request `/static/../../../../../../../etc/passwd`; to avoid this,
  call [os.path.normpath]((stdlib,os.path)) before [os.path.join]((stdlib,os.path)).
