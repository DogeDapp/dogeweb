:class: Worker
  The only thing provided by this module. See
  [gunicorn configuration overview](http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/develop/configure.html#worker-class)
  for details.

  ```bash
  gunicorn -k dogeweb.gunicorn.Worker module:app
  ```


:class: WorkerNG
  A version of [Worker](#Worker) that uses HTTP/2.
  [libh2o](https://github.com/h2o/h2o) and [h2py](https://github.com/pyos/h2py)
  still required for this to work. [aiouv](https://github.com/saghul/aiouv), too.
